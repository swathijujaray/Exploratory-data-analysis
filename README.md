# 🍷 Wine Quality Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the Wine Quality dataset to understand how various physicochemical properties influence wine quality ratings. The analysis uncovers patterns, correlations, and key factors affecting wine quality, helping prepare the data for predictive modeling.

---

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset contains chemical attributes of wine samples along with quality scores assigned by experts.

### Features Include:

* Fixed acidity
* Volatile acidity
* Citric acid
* Residual sugar
* Chlorides
* Free sulfur dioxide
* Total sulfur dioxide
* Density
* pH
* Sulphates
* Alcohol
* **Quality (Target Variable)**

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Explore the distribution of wine quality scores
* Identify important features affecting wine quality
* Detect outliers and anomalies
* Analyze relationships between variables
* Prepare data for machine learning models

---

## 🔍 EDA Workflow

* Data loading and inspection
* Handling missing values and duplicates
* Descriptive statistical analysis
* Univariate analysis (histograms, box plots)
* Bivariate analysis (scatter plots, bar plots)
* Correlation analysis using heatmaps
* Outlier detection using IQR method

---

## 📈 Key Insights

* Alcohol content shows a strong positive correlation with wine quality
* Higher volatile acidity negatively impacts quality
* Most wine samples are rated between **5 and 6**
* Several features are skewed and may require transformation

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
